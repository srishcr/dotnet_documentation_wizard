# .NET Documentation Wizard - User Runbook

## Overview

The .NET Documentation Wizard provides three specialized workflows for comprehensive API analysis and documentation across multiple repositories. Each workflow serves a specific purpose in the API discovery and documentation pipeline.

## Available Workflows

### üîç Workflow 1: Find Repositories with APIs
**Purpose**: Scan all repositories to identify which ones contain API definitions
**Output**: `reports/repositories_with_apis.csv` - Complete inventory of repositories with API analysis

### üó∫Ô∏è Workflow 2: Map Known APIs to Repositories
**Purpose**: Map a list of known APIs to specific repositories and locations
**Output**: `reports/api_to_repository_mapping.csv` - API-to-repository mapping with confidence levels

### üìö Workflow 3: Detailed Repository Analysis
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive documentation for a specific repository
**Output**: Complete `analysis/` folder with business overviews, technical details, API inventory, and individual API documentation

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **ripgrep** - For fast endpoint extraction
  ```bash
  # Install ripgrep (if not already installed)
  brew install ripgrep  # macOS
  sudo apt install ripgrep  # Linux
  ```

### Supported .NET Projects
- ‚úÖ .NET 6+ with Minimal APIs
- ‚úÖ ASP.NET Core MVC applications
- ‚úÖ Traditional Web API projects
- ‚úÖ Mixed architectures with multiple patterns

## How to Use Each Workflow

### üîç Workflow 1: Find Repositories with APIs

**When to Use**: When you need to understand which repositories in your `repositories/` folder contain APIs

#### Trigger Commands
```
Find all repositories with APIs in the repositories folder
```
```
Scan repositories for API definitions using Workflow 1
```
```
Run repository API discovery workflow
```

**What Happens**:
1. **Ultra-fast scan** of `repositories/` folder (file system only)
2. **Immediate .NET filtering** (skip non-.NET repos instantly)
3. **Minimal API detection** using pattern matching (no file reading)
4. **Efficient mono-repo analysis** using project structure
5. Creates `reports/repositories_with_apis.csv`

‚ö†Ô∏è **For Large Codebases (20-30M LOC)**: This workflow is optimized for efficiency with minimal file reading and maximum use of PowerShell/CMD commands for pattern detection on Windows.

üñ•Ô∏è **Windows Users**: All commands use PowerShell (Get-ChildItem, Select-String, Test-Path) with CMD fallbacks. For best performance on large codebases, consider installing ripgrep.

**Expected Output**:
```
reports/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories_with_apis.csv    # Repository inventory with API analysis
```

---

### üó∫Ô∏è Workflow 2: Map Known APIs to Repositories

**When to Use**: When you have a list of known APIs and need to find where they're implemented

#### Prerequisites
- Provide a list of APIs in CSV, Excel, or Markdown format
- Workflow 1 must be completed (requires `repositories_with_apis.csv`)

#### Trigger Commands
```
Map known APIs to repositories using my API list: [path/to/api-list.csv]
```
```
Run API mapping workflow with the provided API inventory
```
```
Execute Workflow 2 to map APIs to repositories
```

**What Happens**:
1. Processes your API list
2. Matches APIs to repositories using intelligent algorithms
3. Assigns confidence levels to matches
4. Creates `reports/api_to_repository_mapping.csv`

**Expected Output**:
```
reports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories_with_apis.csv        # From Workflow 1
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api_to_repository_mapping.csv     # New mapping report
```

### üìö Workflow 3: Detailed Repository Analysis

**When to Use**: When you need comprehensive documentation for a specific repository

#### Prerequisites (Optional)
- Results from Workflows 1 & 2 for enhanced context
- Specific repository path for analysis

#### Trigger Commands
```
Generate comprehensive documentation for this repository using Workflow 3
```
```
Run detailed analysis workflow on repository: [path/to/repository]
```
```
Create complete API documentation for this .NET codebase
```
```
Execute Workflow 3 detailed analysis on [repository-name]
```

**What Happens**:
1. Extracts endpoints using static analyzer
2. Generates business and technical overviews
3. Creates comprehensive API inventory
4. Documents each API with security analysis
5. Performs OWASP security assessment
6. Creates navigable documentation website

**Expected Output**:

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Analysis Pattern
For comprehensive API landscape understanding:
1. **Start with Workflow 1**: Get overview of all repositories
2. **Use Workflow 2**: Map known APIs to repositories
3. **Execute Workflow 3**: Generate detailed documentation for priority repositories

### Focused Analysis Pattern
For specific repository documentation:
- **Jump to Workflow 3**: If you know exactly which repository to analyze

### API Discovery Pattern
For API inventory and mapping:
1. **Run Workflow 1**: Discover API-containing repositories
2. **Use Workflow 2**: Map external API lists to discovered repositories

## Example Trigger Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Enterprise Environment
```
Find all repositories with APIs in the repositories folder
```
*Follow up after Workflow 1 completes:*
```
Map known APIs to repositories using my API list: ./known_apis.csv
```

### Scenario 2: Legacy System Documentation
```
Generate comprehensive documentation for this repository using Workflow 3
```

### Scenario 3: API Compliance Audit
```
Run repository API discovery workflow
```
*Then for each high-priority repository:*
```
Execute Workflow 3 detailed analysis on [repository-name]
```

## Expected Output Examples

- Check folder permissions and access rights
- Verify folder structure is correct

**"Repository scanning failed"**
- Some repositories may be corrupted or incomplete
- Check individual repository access permissions
- Review the CSV output for specific error details

#### Workflow 2 Issues
**"Workflow 1 output not found"**
- Ensure Workflow 1 has been completed successfully
- Check that `reports/repositories_with_apis.csv` exists
- Run Workflow 1 first before attempting Workflow 2

**"API list format not recognized"**
- Ensure your API list is in CSV, Excel, or Markdown format
- Check that required columns are present
- Verify file path is accessible

**"Low confidence matches"**
- Review repository summaries from Workflow 1
- Consider providing more detailed API descriptions
- Manual validation may be required for ambiguous matches

#### Workflow 3 Issues
**"ripgrep not found"**
```bash
# Install ripgrep
brew install ripgrep  # macOS
sudo apt install ripgrep  # Linux
```

**"No endpoints found"**
- Verify you're targeting a .NET project directory
- Check that the project contains API controllers or minimal API definitions
- Ensure the project builds successfully
